## PROJECT CASE

*“I want to implement agile environment in my workplace.”* 

While having this kind of idea on a management level 10 years ago could get ridiculed almost instantly, in today's software project environment agile rewards companies with a greater employee involvement and productivity. 

This Project is a simulation of work environment, where more traditional agile techniques are blended with key gamification concepts of "reward" and "role".
